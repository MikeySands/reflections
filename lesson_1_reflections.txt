1 - How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug?
Didnâ€™t have to go through a thousand lines of code.

2 - How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It allows you to more easily recover from mistakes.

3 - What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? 
It makes the commits more useful since they've been set at more logical points.

4 - Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is created with coders specifically in mind while other may have a broader target range.

5 - How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
The git log shows you when commits are made and dif shows you a summary between any 2 files of your choice from the log.

6 - How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because it means that changes are reversible.

7 - Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To conquer the world.
